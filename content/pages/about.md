📍 Hey there! I'm Avinash Dhillor, a 26-year-old software developer hailing from vibrant India 🌟. 
I started my programming journey in 2016 during my 1st year of University. Java became my first love, I learned its core functionality, file handling, buffer, streams and object-oriented programming concepts. As part of my university curriculum, I also got acquainted with C and C++, where I honed my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms and solved programming problems on platforms like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Hackerank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) etc. During my 2nd year of university i took Machine Learning and Advance java training course from C-DAC institute. There, I gained knowledge about machine learning models, neural networks, and the math behind them. 
In my third year, I dived into Node.js, completing courses on JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Socket.js, and React/Redux on platforms like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). These skills opened up exciting possibilities in web development.

📍 After graduating in 2020, I joined Fidelity International as a software developer. Here, I work with Java, Node.js, AWS services, Python, Docker, Terraform, and other tools to build backend microservices.

📍 Beyond work, I enjoy exploring open-source projects, solving problems on platforms like Leetcode, participating in coding contests and [hackathons](#), and working on personal projects to learn new technologies. I also find inspiration in technology blogs and live streams by fellow developers.

📍 Currently, I'm focusing on enhancing my knowledge of system design, design principles, and design patterns. I make it a habit to solve daily programming problems on different online coding platforms.

📍 Feel free to connect with me through the social links on my blog or my [Bento](https://bento.me/avinashdhillor) page. Let's exchange ideas, collaborate, and grow together as developers.
