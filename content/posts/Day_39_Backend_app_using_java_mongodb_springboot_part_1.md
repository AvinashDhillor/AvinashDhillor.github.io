# Project Idea

This project idea was to build backend application which provide functionality of clans. At high level this provide following functionalities.

- Creating or deleting clans
- Adding/Updaing/Removing/Moving memebers into clans.
- Storing score of users
- Calculating total score of clans by suming up all users score.

### Tech stack used -
- Java v20
- MongoDB as database
- Spring boot and MongoRepository for db operations


Main intention of this project was to build backend of discord bot and also learn mongodb integration with Java, Since i had used mongodb alot using nodejs but i want to test in java and how easy and faster it is to build applications. MongoRepository makes work alot easier but it do have some learning curve and might face some errors initially to perform custom operations. But overall it makes work easy and easy to implement new features.

Whole source code is available on Github, Ofcourse easy to understand also:-
