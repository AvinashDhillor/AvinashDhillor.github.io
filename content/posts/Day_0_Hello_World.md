Hello World, 

I started this blog to share my daily learning progress. I love to solve daily Leetcode challenges. I use Java, Nodejs and AWS for backend development. You can find more about me in [About](/pages/about) section. Also i keep my content organized you can find details in [Collection](/pages/collection) section.

I also use other technology stack (just a hobby) like React/Redux, Python, Three.js, Blender, Bash scripting etc. But these technology are not part of my by daily work but i am pretty much familiar with it and just use it for my personal projects.

Before this blog i used to keep my notes in [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app), Which is pretty amazing tool to make notes, draw diagrams etc. But i found blog a better alternative to keep track of my daily progress.

I'm pretty much excited to start tracking my progress journey via blog and will try to maintain consistency and keep things organized.
