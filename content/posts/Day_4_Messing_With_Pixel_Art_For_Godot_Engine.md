While learning about Godot engine, i realized i need assets to build game. There are different types of assets exists for different type of game. I had saw [bytelegand](https://bytelegend.com/) game few days back during a live session which is made in LibGDX. By reading docs of bytelegand i came to know about tilesmap. i wonder if this could be possible to create tileset on my own. Although so many websites exist where you can get free sources or just pay small ammount to get the assets. But still i decided to explore option of build my own.

First i tried to watch tutorial on what is tilemap? what is tileset? And what are sprites?. So all of these are PNG images which can be build using any photo editor tool like **Gimp**, ***Photoshop**, **Krita** etc. They are generally small size images either 16x16, 32x32 ... so on. A tileset and spritesheet is just a large size image which contains all the smaller png images (it's like all image in one place). We can use these image to create animation or tileset to build our tilemap in Godot.

So Next question was how easy it is two build 2D pixel art image?. i watched some video and tried to made a small tree by adding some color, shading and light. But it was not so perfect. By watching some other tutorials i came to know about another tool which is specifically made for making 2D pixel Art. It was [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). But it cost almost 20$. Since i was just learning and exploring, it's was not worth to spend money on it. After exploring more i found Aseprite open source version which is [Libresprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) and [PixilArt](https://www.pixilart.com/).


I tried making some 2D assets but it was not that i expected. So it does require a lot of practice and learning to get at that level, It is not just few days process. For people like me who are most into programming, it is good option to buy assets lib from online platform rather then spending time on it(unless you really want to learn it).
