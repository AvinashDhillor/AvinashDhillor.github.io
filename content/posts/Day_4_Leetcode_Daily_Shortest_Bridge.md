## Problem - [934. Shortest Bridge](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/description/)

### Level - Medium
---

### Solution

---
**Approach:**

In this problem we have to find the shortest path between two island. So we simple have to first find all the connected Vertex of 1st island. That could be done using DFS. Once we have all Vertex of 1st island, Then we can find distance for 1st island node to 2nd island using BFS. By doing that for all nodes we can find the minimum distance to connect the two islands.
